     Overview
===================

This program demos several computational geometry algorithms:
-Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees
-Convex Hulls
-Delaunay Triangulations
-Voronoi Diagrams

      Usage
===================

Left click on the canvas to add a new vertex.
Left click and drag a vertex to move it.
Right click on a vertex to delete it.
The different algorithms can be accessed using the "Algorithms" menu.
The canvas can be cleared using the "Clear" menu item under "Edit".

===================
     Build
===================
This program was built using Qt 4.7.0. After installing the framework, run
> qmake
